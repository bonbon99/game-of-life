# Game of Life

## Introduction

Welcome to my first project in any language. It's in Python 3 and it uses the library PyGame to display the board.

The Game of Life is an animated sequence of "cells" represented by filled-in tiles on a grid. See more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Setup

To run, install [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) and then use Python to run `game-of-life.py`.
